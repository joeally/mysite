I started this blog mainly to document my explorations into various topics within the areas of programming and computer science as a kind of a record of my extra-curricular activities.

Coming soon is a series on generating (vaguely) plausible random text based on Markov chains using [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org). In the series I'll also talk about using the [redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store and creating a web application to serve up the random text. I may also post about [ClojureScript](http//www.clojure.org/clojurescript) in conjunction with the web stuff.
